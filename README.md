(This is where we submit our Tasks/Homeworks/Milestones)

Milestone #1 - Simple GUI with features like Calendar, View Employee Records, leave Record and User Authentication 
              (Make sure the path for CSV is right for the User authentication to work) Still W.I.P but main features are completely working.
